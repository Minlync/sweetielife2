If you think using a special grater is the only possible way to zest a lemon, think again. While having this tool on hand will certainly make zesting easier, it's not strictly necessary. If you don't have one, you can use a sharp knife to slice off thin slices of the peel, then finely chop them. Voil√†, lemon zest.
