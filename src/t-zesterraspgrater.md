        <p>If you think using a special grater is the only possible way to zest a lemon, think again. While having this tool on hand will certainly make zesting easier, it's not strictly necessary. If you don't have one, you can use a sharp knife to slice off thin slices of the peel, then finely chop them. Voilà, lemon zest.</p>
       <p>Commercial-quality chrome-plated-steel rack with closely set wires.</p>
       <p>Easily supports breads and cakes; prevents cookies from slipping through.</p>
       <p>Fits inside a standard half-sheet pan for glazing and finishing baked goods.</p>
       <p>Raised design lets air circulate underneath, keeping undersides crisp.</p>
        <!-- <p>•Can be used repeatedly.</p> -->
        <!-- <p>•Easy-to-clean and good temperature resistance.</p> -->

         <p>No one wants soggy, overbaked cookies and cakes for dessert, so make sure you've got a wire rack on hand. This handy tool allows air to circulate around baked goods as they cool, so they'll taste just as great at room temperature as they did fresh from the oven.</p>
