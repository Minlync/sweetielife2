        <p>•This sifter holds more flour or powdered sugar than most sifters made for home use. Measurements are stamped right into the metal and can easily be read from inside the sifter as well as outside.</p>
       <p>•Professionals prefer crank-style sifters over hand squeeze sifter models because they can stand up to repeated use without tiring out your hand. Sifting is effortless and clean up is super simple - no multi-layers of mesh for ingredients to get stuck</p>
        <!-- <p>•Can be used repeatedly.</p> -->
        <!-- <p>•Easy-to-clean and good temperature resistance.</p> -->

         <p>A basic crank-style sifter is a favorite among bakers, and this 3-cup sifter shows exactly why that is. The sifter is tough enough to handle different types of flour and other coarse ingredients, like bran or almond meal. The canister has measurement markings engraved into the metal to read on the inside of the sifter. This way, you can measure amounts as you pour them into the sifter or see how much more you have left to sift. The manufacturer recommends simply wiping this clean with a cloth rather than immersing it in water, but some reviewers have hand-washed the sifter, and others have washed it in the dishwasher with no issues.</p>
