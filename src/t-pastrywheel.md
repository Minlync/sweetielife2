This tool is handy for frequent pie-makers, but not necessary for more casual bakers. It can definitely be used to cut pastry dough smoothly, but in a pinch, you can use a sharp knife instead. Just be sure to make level slices rather than one long cut, as dragging a knife through pastry can tear and toughen it.
