        <h1>Wooden Pastry Board / Bread Kenading Board</h1>
        <p> While you don't need to go all-out on a fancy stand mixer, you do need at least a hand mixer in your arsenal of baking essentials. It will make mixing doughs and batters faster and easier, and it's by far the best way to mix ingredients into a thick, stiff cookie dough without tiring out your arm.</p>
